# AdoptNV
I've always wanted to code something that could positively impact the world.

The purpose of *AdoptNV* is to facilitate pet adoption in Nevada (USA) by creating a central search repository, one 
that can be accessed from any Internet-connected device. I've limited it to Nevada to focus on helping my local 
community and to keep the project within a reasonable scope.

This has **no affiliation** with any shelter, but currently the search results come from The Animal Foundation in Las 
Vegas. Other shelters will be implemented.

This project is one big learning experience. A Web application was chosen for portability and accessibility, but you 
may also run AdoptNV through the terminal.
