# AdoptNV (early prototype)
The purpose of *AdoptNV* is to facilitate pet adoption in the U.S. state of Nevada by creating a central animal shelter
repository that can be accessed from any Internet-connected device and help humans connect with their perfect companion.

This has **no affiliation** with any shelter, but currently the search results come from The Animal Foundation in Las 
Vegas. Other shelters will be implemented, but I have limited it to Nevada to focus on helping my local community and 
to keep the project within a reasonable scope. 

This project is one big learning experience. Technologies involved:
